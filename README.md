Automating Login with Selenium 

This repository contains a Selenium automation script for automating the login process to a web application. The script is designed to demonstrate how to use Selenium WebDriver to interact with web elements, handle user inputs, and verify successful logins. Please note that this is a test environment and the credentials used are not real. Therefore, we are not actually logging in successfully; instead, a notification on the page indicates that the test executed successfully.
